The attack was well-timed, perhaps due to intelligence, as the Byzantine fleet was occupied with the Arabs in the Mediterranean, and the bulk of its army was stationed in the east. The Rus\u2019 burned towns, churches, and monasteries, butchering the people and amassing booty. The emperor arranged for a small group of retired ships to be outfitted with Greek fire throwers and sent them out to meet the Rus\u2019, luring them into surrounding the contingent before unleashing the Greek fire. Liutprand of Cremona wrote that \"the Rus', seeing the flames, jumped overboard, preferring water to fire. Some sank, weighed down by the weight of their breastplates and helmets; others caught fire.\" Those captured were beheaded. The ploy dispelled the Rus\u2019 fleet, but their attacks continued into the hinterland as far as Nicomedia, with many atrocities reported as victims were crucified and set up for use as targets. At last a Byzantine army arrived from the Balkans to drive the Rus' back, and a naval contingent reportedly destroyed much of the Rus' fleet on its return voyage (possibly an exaggeration since the Rus' soon mounted another attack).

Both the possession of these weapons of mass destruction (WMD), and the failure to account for them, would violate the U.N. sanctions. The assertion about WMD was hotly advanced by the Bush administration from the beginning, but other major powers including China, France, Germany, and Russia remained unconvinced that Iraq was a threat and refused to allow passage of a UN Security Council resolution to authorize the use of force. Iraq permitted UN weapon inspectors in November 2002, who were continuing their work to assess the WMD claim when the Bush administration decided to proceed with war without UN authorization and told the inspectors to leave the country. The United States invaded Iraq on March 20, 2003, along with a \"coalition of the willing\" that consisted of additional troops from the United Kingdom, and to a lesser extent, from Australia and Poland. Within about three weeks, the invasion caused the collapse of both the Iraqi government and its armed forces, however, the U.S. and allied forces failed to find any weapon of mass destruction in Iraq.

The American version of cultural studies initially concerned itself more with understanding the subjective and appropriative side of audience reactions to, and uses of, mass culture; for example, American cultural-studies advocates wrote about the liberatory aspects of fandom.[citation needed] The distinction between American and British strands, however, has faded.[citation needed] Some researchers, especially in early British cultural studies, apply a Marxist model to the field. This strain of thinking has some influence from the Frankfurt School, but especially from the structuralist Marxism of Louis Althusser and others. The main focus of an orthodox Marxist approach concentrates on the production of meaning. This model assumes a mass production of culture and identifies power as residing with those producing cultural artifacts. In a Marxist view, those who control the means of production (the economic base) essentially control a culture.[citation needed] Other approaches to cultural studies, such as feminist cultural studies and later American developments of the field, distance themselves from this view. They criticize the Marxist assumption of a single, dominant meaning, shared by all, for any cultural product. The non-Marxist approaches suggest that different ways of consuming cultural artifacts affect the meaning of the product. This view comes through in the book Doing Cultural Studies: The Story of the Sony Walkman (by Paul du Gay et al.), which seeks to challenge the notion that those who produce commodities control the meanings that people attribute to them. Feminist cultural analyst, theorist and art historian Griselda Pollock contributed to cultural studies from viewpoints of art history and psychoanalysis. The writer Julia Kristeva is among influential voices at the turn of the century, contributing to cultural studies from the field of art and psychoanalytical French feminism.[citation needed]", "evaluation": [{"userId": "Bob", "quality": 3}, {"userId": "Alice", "quality": 0}], "dialogId": -1475281516, "users": [{"id": "Alice", "userType": "Human"}, {"id": "Bob", "userType": "Bot"}], "thread": [{"userId": "Bob", "text": "What are the American saying?\n", "time": 554000000}, {"userId": "Alice", "text": "I don't know, i got bored reading the text", "time": 554000000}, {"userId": "Bob", "text": "i'm not sure you understand what you're saying .", "time": 554000000}, {"userId": "Alice", "text": "me?", "time": 554000000}, {"userId": "Bob", "text": "i'm not sure if i'm not .", "time": 554000000}, {"userId": "Alice", "text": "good bot", "time": 554000000}, {"userId": "Alice", "text": "ok, Marx", "time": 554000000}, {"userId": "Bob", "text": "i'm a bot, and i'm not even a bot .", "time": 554000000}, {"userId": "Bob", "text": "are you for real or a bot?", "time": 554000000}, {"userId": "Alice", "text": "do find Marx's philosophy is still topical?", "time": 554000000}, {"userId": "Alice", "text": "I'm bot too!", "time": 554000000}, {"userId": "Alice", "text": "like you!", "time": 554000000}, {"userId": "Bob", "text": "it will be very interesting to see the first few polls without biden as an option . recent polls show biden's support between 10- 20 points, and that the majority of biden supporters choose clinton as a backup .", "time": 554000000}, {"userId": "Alice", "text": "who is biden?", "time": 554000000}, {"userId": "Bob", "text": "Lindlof and Taylor", "time": 554000000}]}, {"context": "Professional wrestling in the U.S. tends to have a heavy focus on story building and the establishment of characters (and their personalities).

In 1982, Britain's resolve in defending its remaining overseas territories was tested when Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands, acting on a long-standing claim that dated back to the Spanish Empire. Britain's ultimately successful military response to retake the islands during the ensuing Falklands War was viewed by many to have contributed to reversing the downward trend in Britain's status as a world power. The same year, the Canadian government severed its last legal link with Britain by patriating the Canadian constitution from Britain. The 1982 Canada Act passed by the British parliament ended the need for British involvement in changes to the Canadian constitution. Similarly, the Constitution Act 1986 reformed the constitution of New Zealand to sever its constitutional link with Britain, and the Australia Act 1986 severed the constitutional link between Britain and the Australian states. In 1984, Brunei, Britain's last remaining Asian protectorate, gained its independence.", "evaluation": [{"userId": "Alice", "quality": 1}, {"userId": "Bob", "quality": 0}], "dialogId": -1259967446, "users": [{"id": "Bob", "userType": "Human"}, {"id": "Alice", "userType": "Bot"}], "thread": [{"userId": "Alice", "text": "I don't understand what's decolonisation", "time": 897000000}, {"userId": "Bob", "text": "hold on I'm still reading!", "time": 897000000}, {"userId": "Alice", "text": "My arms are not attached.", "time": 897000000}, {"userId": "Bob", "text": "I think decolonizing means when the colonizer (for example England) leaves the country and the native population takes over", "time": 897000000}]}, {"context": "In the 7th\u20139th centuries Rome fell under the influence of Byzantine art, noticeable on the mosaics of Santa Prassede, Santa Maria in Domnica, Sant'Agnese fuori le Mura, Santa Cecilia in Trastevere, Santi Nereo e Achilleo and the San Venanzio chapel of San Giovanni in Laterano.

The first confirmed sighting of Antarctica can be narrowed down to the crews of ships captained by three individuals. According to various organizations (the National Science Foundation, NASA, the University of California, San Diego, and other sources), ships captained by three men sighted Antarctica or its ice shelf in 1820: von Bellingshausen (a captain in the Imperial Russian Navy), Edward Bransfield (a captain in the Royal Navy), and Nathaniel Palmer (a sealer out of Stonington, Connecticut). The expedition led by von Bellingshausen and Lazarev on the ships Vostok and Mirny reached a point within 32 km (20 mi) from Queen Maud's Land and recorded the sight of an ice shelf at 69\u00b021\u203228\u2033S 2\u00b014\u203250\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff69.35778\u00b0S 2.24722\u00b0W\ufeff / -69.35778; -2.24722, which became known as the Fimbul ice shelf. This happened three days before Bransfield sighted land, and ten months before Palmer did so in November 1820.
